There is just one command and you can place it anywhere in your path.
If your editor supports it there is a JSON Schema for the definition.
We publish OS X and Linux homebrew packages:
$ brew tap choria-io/tap $ brew install choria-io/tap/appbuilder Hello World We will make a little command that invokes cowsay to demonstrate some of the capabilities of the system.</description></item><item><title>Reference</title><link>https://choria-io.github.io/appbuilder/reference/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://choria-io.github.io/appbuilder/reference/</guid><description>Command Components The system primarily is there to execute a type of command somewhere in the hierarchy of a CLI tools sub commands.
Lets say we have an app called demo that has commands demo say and demo think the say and think bits are commands. In this example these are commands of type exec - they run a shell command.
If we had a command demo deploy status and demo deploy upgrade then generally the deploy would not perform any action, it&amp;rsquo;s there mainly to achor sub commands and show help information.</description></item></channel></rss>

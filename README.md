This is a tool to help operations teams wrap their myriad shell scripts, multi line kubectl invocations, jq commands and
more all in one friendly CLI tool that's easy to use and share.

## Status

This is a brand new project that's under active development, we are extracting the core out of the maain Choria project
into a standalone component.
